# Poth

Porth is a stack based language similar to Forth. Features of Porth are -

- [x] Compiled
- [x] Native
- [x] Stack based
- [ ] Turing complete
- [ ] Statically typed (the type checking system will be similar to WASM validation)
- [ ] Self hosted (currently Python is being used for initial bootstrapping, but later when the language will be mature enough, we will rewrite Porth using Porth to implement new features and enhancements)

## Quick start

```sh
python3 main.py ./examples/example.porth
./output
```
